# User-Login-System

A basic Login / Register form, using `NodeJs`, `Express`, `BcryptsJS` and `Passport` for authentication 
and `MongoDB` to store and retrieve user's credentials

## What I learned in this project: 
* MVC layout model with Express 
* Middleare set up, separation of concerns
* Using Express Router to handle routes
* Use Express features like messages, session and validator
* MongoDB database and collection set up 
* Utilizing Multer to store images in our project 
* Password hashing with BcryptJS
* Authentication using passport 

## Technologies I used: 
* Express 
* [BcryptJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
* Passport 
* Body-Parser
* Jade
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Morgan 
* [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)
* [Connect-Flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-flash)

## How to get started: 
* Fork this repo 
* Clone it to your local machine
* In the bash / terminal access the root folder of the project
* run `npm install` to set up all the dependencies 
* run `npm start` and go into your browser your [Local Host 3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Note: 
* It is required to have MongoDB installed globally into your machine, and set up the database in order for the app to store images 
  and user credentials in the database. 
* Some packgaes like Jade are a bit obsolete but they do work, and you want the newest version of Jade you have to install [Pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug)
